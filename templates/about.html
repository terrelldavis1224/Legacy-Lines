<h1>Inspiration</h1>

<br>
<p>Legacy Lines was inspired by 
    the idea of creating a game that captures the essence and appeal of popular titles like Wordle, Pokedoku, and Globle.
With the spin of a sports twist, I wanted to create a game that would be fun, engaging like picking over/unders.
      </p>
    <br>

    <h1>Note</h1>

    <p>If the main player's statistics are tied
     with another player's statistics, then choosing the 'Under' will yield the correct answer.If Thanasis Antetokounmpo has 0 points
      and Kevin Durant also has 0 points, then the choice that will yield the correct result is 'Under'.</p>
